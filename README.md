# To do list App

* The "To Do List" project was developed using React Native in conjunction with AsyncStorage.
* The primary goal of this application was to create a functional and practical to-do list.
* The application offers an initial screen where tasks are displayed, allowing actions such as adding, deleting one or all tasks, and editing the details of each one.
* Additionally, the app includes a details screen for each task, and the information is saved and retrieved using AsyncStorage.

* The "To Do List" provides users with an effective way to manage their daily tasks, keeping everything organized and accessible directly from their mobile devices.
